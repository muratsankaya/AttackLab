## Phase_2 Solution 

The goal of this phase is to call the function <touch2> with the unique cookie for target24 as the single argument. The idea is to 
set %rip to the address of the inserted assembly instruction that moves the value of the cookie to %rdi, and then return/jump to touch2. 

&nbsp;  
  
The main challenge of this phase is to clearly understand the dynamics of the procedures. Writing assembly code is the easy part which 
consists of two lines of x86-64 code that is decoded into sequences of hexadecimals with the programs included in the initial tar file. 

&nbsp;  
  
Continuing from the <getbuf> procedure which is detailed in the phase_1 solution, when getbuf is called the exploit string must input data 
in a way that when the program tries to return from getbuf should jump to the beginning of of the instructions that set %rdi a to the value of the cookies. Then jump to the beginning of touch2. 

&nbsp;
  
The decoded mov instruction consists of 8 bytes, which can be positioned at anyplace within size allocated for the buffer. For the sake 
of fun I placed the code in the middle of the buffer for target24. Then the location to the beginning of the instruction must be computed 
and positioned right above the beginning getbufâ€™s stack frame. After the program tries to return and jumps to the beginning of the inserted 
instructions, it also pops %rsp, consequently %rsp starts pointing 8 bytes above from where it was pointing when executing the retq instruction 
for getbuf. Hence that is the location where the address of touch2 must be located. (Note: after retq %rip is set to the address which %rsp is 
pointing to)
